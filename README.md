# Pathway Pizza

â€‹

## Goal

This is a full-stack application for a fictitious pizza shop. We were tasked with creating a web app that allowed customers to order pizza and view the menu and allowed employees to update menu items and order status.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** and **Spring Boot** were used to serve our pizza shop's RESTful API
- Our API interfaced with our **PostgreSQL** database
- Our front end was built with **Vue.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- As a team of five people, we used **Agile** methodologies to work together creating the app
- (_In progress_) The front end of the app is hosted on Github Pages
- (_In progress_) The back end of the app will be hosted on **AWS**
